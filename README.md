# It's a project to make people aware of the environment.

## Now we don't know what happens when the Earth rises one degree.

## If you ask the person next to you, the glacier will melt, it will heat up, and you will only act and think within the limited knowledge we know.

## I hope these actions and common sense have been taken so seriously that a lot of people can start by starting with a small project.

## This project starts with small activities of 2 students.

## I do not know how this behavior will affect many people. But I think it can create effects that will make you aware of the situation and bring together solutions.

## We'll start with a small whip site and start increasing our activity.
